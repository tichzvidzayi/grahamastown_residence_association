## About This Project

This is an early web application project I developed back in 2015. As one of my first attempts at building web apps, it serves as a snapshot of my initial learning journey and coding style at the time. You may notice some mistakes or less-than-ideal coding practices throughout the codebaseâ€”these were intentionally left uncorrected to preserve the authenticity of my early work. 

By keeping these imperfections intact, I aim to provide a clear contrast between where I started and how much I have grown as a developer since then. This project is a valuable reference point that highlights the foundational skills I built upon and the lessons I learned along the way. I hope it offers insight into the evolution of my approach to web development and inspires others who are just beginning their coding journeys.
