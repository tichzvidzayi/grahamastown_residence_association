								<h3>MAKANA REVENUE AND DEBT COLLECTION MEETING</h3>
							</header>
							
							<p class="f-left">November 1, 2016 | Posted by <a href="#">Steven Lang</a>
							
							<br><p> The amount of outstanding uncollected debt in Makana is not as discouraging as many of us might believe. And the prospects for increased revenues are improving, according to the company responsible for collecting on unpaid bills.Revenue Consulting (Revco) CEO, Sheldon Goodall, revealed the good news to a meeting of about 35 people organised by the Grahamstown Residents Association (GRA) on Tuesday evening.Most participants came to the meeting to get a better understanding of their Makana utility bills and how best to correct mistakes in their bills. Almost all residents had a horror story about being grossly overcharged or having wildly fluctuating charges. However, GRA chair, Philip Machanick made it clear that Goodall had not come to resolve individual queries, but rather to explain how his company intended improving debt collection in the municipality.Sensing that the atmosphere might become a little hostile, Machanick appealed to residents to keep questions civil.Goodall explained that Revco only collected outstanding debts that were handed over to the company by Makana municipality.<br> In other words, Revco would not arbitrarily demand payment from anyone without good reason. He stressed that his company complied strictly with all relevant laws and regulations, but that if anyone was unhappy with the way it conducted business, he was always open to discussions.The Revco CEO said that there are many reasons why people don’t or can’t pay their bills. However, whatever the reason, it is important to engage with the debt collector to resolve any disputes or problems. He encouraged people to take heed if they receive a warning letter or SMS. Instead of ignoring the warning they should rather open a formal complaint so that disputes could be resolved.Goodall made it clear that legal action was only an option of last resort because it was expensive and not very helpful. He said he preferred to consult with customers so that they could work out a payment plan with the municipality and that in 99 percent of such cases they are able to reach a workable solution.One of the biggest problems facing Makana residents is the unpredictability of charges for electricity and water.<br> Municipal bills tend to rise and fall considerably making it difficult for households to budget from one month to the next and keep up with payments.Some variation is to be expected as households tend to use more electricity for heating in the winter and more water for watering gardens in the summer.Goodall addressed concerns about huge outstanding debts that the municipality has not been able to collect in recent years. It has not written off bad debt even though it is normal practice is to cancel irrecoverable debt after a certain period. This decision created a false impression that the money would come in and placed an unrealistic strain on the municipal budgeting process. Retaining bad debt on its books implied that the outstanding debt would be recovered, whereas in fact a significant proportion will never be collected.The number of households belonging to deceased estates was another headache for the municipality. There are more than 3 600 such households that in many cases receive municipal services that they do not pay for.<br> It is difficult for the municipality to recover outstanding amounts because it has no contractual agreement with the current residents of the house.Everyone at the meeting agreed that one of the hardest working people at the municipality is Diane May, the acting revenue manager who spends many hours every day resolving account queries brought into her office. Some residents believe May needs more people to help in her office.Goodall said that residents are welcome to contact him or his company about any queries regarding debt collection. His contact details are:Sheldon Goodall, CEO of Revenue Consulting Pty, info@revco.co.za or to contact a person assigned to Eastern Cape queries: ec@revco.co.za or tel: 043-721 3075 and their website is www.revco.co.za </p>.

								<h3>REPORT BACK ON THE GRAHAMSTOWN CONVERSATION</h3>
								<h4>Held at PRIME, 63 New Street on Thursday 25 August 2016</h4>
							</header>

							<p>Congratulations to Grahamstown Business Forum (GBF) for staging this valuable and well attended event. Thank you to Acting MM Riana Meiring who attended along with her Makana Directors. The excellent venue was provided by Mynhardt van Dyk from The Rat and Parrot.There was a diverse cross-section of about 160 Grahamstown people who came to hear <br>Tony Lankester : CEO National Arts Festival <br>Nomhle Gaga : Executive Mayor of Makana Municipality <br> Matthew Lester : Professor Rhodes University Business School  Proceedings were introduced by Richard Gaybba, vice-chairperson of GBF. <br>He outlined how this event is a starting point, to bring ‘people and ideas’ together, for the wider benefit of Makana. This point was taken up by Matthew Lester who pointed out that Grahamstown has a wealth of brain power, far exceeding the average for a city the size of Grahamstown. Richard then introduced the partners behind this event and also drew attention to the fact that the three speakers are major role players in Grahamstown.Richard explained that GBF is a voluntary organisation, representing the business interests within Grahamstown and welcomes new members to join. He also highlighted the advantage of the various organisations in Grahamstown communicating and working collaboratively to improve the running of the city.He then spoke about two current GBF projects, both connected with cleaning up the city centre. The first is a partnership between GBF, Makana, Creative City and Grahamstown Residents’ Association to clear up the streets, with particular thanks to Mike Webber who is providing his Rentall Skips free of charge. The second is a plan to replace all the broken dustbins in the city centre and reach an agreement about servicing the bins so they are emptied regularly. </p>
